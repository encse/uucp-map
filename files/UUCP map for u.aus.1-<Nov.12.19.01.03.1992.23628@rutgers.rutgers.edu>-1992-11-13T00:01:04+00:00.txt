#
# Australia - Domains not restricted to a single state or territory
#
# u.aus.1
#	top level connectivity
# u.aus.2
#	Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization domains
# u.aus.3
#	domains which span more than one state or territory (except CSIRO)
#	domains and hosts whose location is unknown to the map maintainer

# The entries in all map files for Australia are grouped by
# third-level domain (if any) and ordered alphabetically thereon, with
# other level domains considered irrelevant, so
#	cec.edu.au < carbon.chem.csiro.au < cocam.oz.au
#	^                   ^               ^
# would be the relevant order if these entries occurred in the same
# map file.
#
# If several domains logically belong together they are grouped
# together.  This is especially true where the preferred domain has
# changed.  Many subdomains of csiro.au were previously in oz.au, as
# were many universities now in edu.au.
#
# Similarly, a number of names of hosts directly in oz.au are historical
# artifacts of ancient ACSnet software.  Such hosts are sometimes listed
# with their short aliases, rather than their longer canonical names,
# although this is changing.  Regardless, they are still grouped with the
# related domains or hosts.
#
# Where there are a number of entries related to each other within a domain,
# the entries may be bracketed by lines `# /' above and `# \' below.
#
# `Private networks', in the pathalias(8) sense, are used for
# maintaining routing information.  All these have names beginning with
# `aarnet-', `acsnet-', or `australia-'.  The distinction is that
# members of `aarnet-' networks are known to be IP-connected,
# `acsnet-' networks are reachable via ACSnet/MHSnet routing and include
# non-AARNet members of .oz.au, while members of `australia-' networks
# are presumed reachable by some other means, possibly including uucp.
#
# I attempt to keep the information in these maps consistent with
#	the Internet DNS (Domain Name Service)
#	routing tables for MHSnet (SunIV?) as seen at sserve.cc.adfa.oz.au
#	routing tables for ACSnet (SunIII) as seen at munnari.oz.au
