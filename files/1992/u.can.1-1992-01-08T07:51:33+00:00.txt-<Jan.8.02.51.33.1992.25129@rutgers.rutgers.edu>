# IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that local gateways, to NetNorth, CDNnet, and

#	CRIM.CA is a Non-Profit Corporation
#
#	The official inauguration of CRIM in 1985 concluded the efforts
#	of a number of Quebec universities, industries and government 
#	to set up, in Montreal, a computer science research centre 
#	where researchers from the university and industrial sectors 
#	could collaborate in areas of research such as Artificial 
#	Intelligence, Expert Systems, Software Engineering, Man-Machine
#	Interfaces, Telematics, VLSI, CAD, Databases...
#	
#	Another mandate of CRIM is to contribute to the development
#	of highly qualified manpower, particularly at the doctoral 
#	level.  In this way, CRIM administers a scholarship program 
#	for approximately 60 Master's and Doctorate level students 
#	associated with the A.S. Programs of the Ministere de 
#	l'Enseignement Superieur et de la Science.  For these reasons
#	CRIM has received a University status from various branches
#	of the federal and provincial governments.
#	
#	The establishment of an effective computer communications 
#	network for researchers is one way to meet CRIM's objectives 
#	and is the reason for CRIM's involvement in provincial
#	(RISQ), national, and international networking.
