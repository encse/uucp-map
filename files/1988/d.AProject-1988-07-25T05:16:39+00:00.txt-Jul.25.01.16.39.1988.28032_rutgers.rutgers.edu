#  This is the UUCP Mapping Project's miscellaneous data file.  Here you'll
#  find temporary patches which, because of this file's name, will become part
#  of the input to pathalias.  In general, we will use this file to keep
#  pathalias from generating known bad or unreliable paths.

# The current AT&T map entry claims links to the outside world.
# Unfortunately, only AT&T internal sites are allowed to take advantage of
# these links.  The UUCP Project is in the process of having AT&T remove
# these links from its distributed map entry.  Until that time, all AT&T
# external links are declared DEAD here to keep the rest of us from
# attempting to use these links.....
