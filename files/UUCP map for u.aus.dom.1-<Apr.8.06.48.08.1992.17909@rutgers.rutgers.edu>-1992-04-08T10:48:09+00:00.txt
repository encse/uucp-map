# Australia - notable hosts in the 'oz' domain

# These are given so pathalias can produce routes using addresses
# like "aaec!user" which tends to be what the news code likes
# to produce.  Only a small subset of "oz" is listed here, being a
# very subjectively chosen list of hosts that I think it likely
# that people are likely to want to reach with uucp style addresses

# the domains are purely local (only here to make the addresses right)
