# This is the current list of machines that have agreed to make the UUCP map
# available to the UUCP community (or some subset of).  The maps on these
# machines are the same as posted here in the comp.mail.maps newsgroup.  If
# you missed a file or need an update before it is modified again, please use
# the machine on this list which is closest to your area, and abide by the
# rules set up by the administrator of that machine.  Also, please keep in
# mind that the UUCP map is updated on a continual basis.  You can be assured
# of receiving the posting if you can wait though the 1st of two consecutive
# months.  If you can wait this long, we encourage you to do so.  This is a
# service provided on a volunteer basis by these machines, and if the
# privilege is abused, it will likely disappear.
#
# The map posted monthly has been checked as a unit for errors; the daily maps
# sometimes contain errors which are cleaned up in the monthly posting.

# Site ihnp4 - AT&T Bell Laboratories
# 	     Naperville, IL
# 
# 
# To pick up the UUCP map from ihnp4, use the command:
# 
# 	uucp -m ihnp4!‾/uumap/.info !‾/uumap/
# 
# 		After you receive notification:
# 
# 	cat /usr/spool/uucppublic/uumap/.info
# 
# 		and follow the instructions.
# 
# If ihnp4 has a direct connection to your system, an alternative is:
# 
# 	uux ihnp4!uupub uumap
# 
# 		ihnp4 will send the uucpmap database to your
# 		system!‾/uumap/ and will mail you notification.

# 		(609) 452-3586
# 
# The uucpmap information will be available to our uucp neighbors as files in
# the directory /usr/spool/uucppublic/uumap  == ‾uucp/uumap == ‾/uumap .
# Please pick them up outside of working hours, preferably from 12 am. to
# 8 am. Eastern time.
# 
# I suggest first pulling over the file astrovax!‾/uumap/LISTING which
# contains the list of uucp map files in the astrovax!‾/uumap directory.  Then
# pull over the files listed in that file.  That way if the connection is hung
# up by line noise the transfer will not have to restart from the beginning.

# The files are available in nbires!‾uucp/uumap.  A current directory listing

# 	      (703) 276-7900
# 
# On seismo, the uucp map will be available in the directory ‾uucp/uumap.
# Each state,etc. will have a file containing the data for uucpsites
# in that state. The filename will be the same as that used for the Usenet
# map (e.g. usa.va, usa.oh, eur.nl, can.on, etc).
# 
# A listing of the files in the directory can be obtained by running
# 	uux seismo!listmap user@site.UUCP
# where user@site.UUCP is a return address for mail.
# 
# Sites already having uucp connections with seismo may uucp the map at
# any time, but should initiate the call if it is long distance.
# 
# ARPAnet sites will find the data in the same format in ‾ftp/uumap on seismo.
# It may be ftped with the standard anonymous login.

# (substituting your mail address for "mylogin@mysite.UUCP", of course).
# The directions for access and transfer will be mailed back to you.

# Gatech's uucp does not support uucp login except by "known" contacts.
