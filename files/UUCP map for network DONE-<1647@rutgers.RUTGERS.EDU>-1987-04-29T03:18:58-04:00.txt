# This is the current list of machines that have agreed to make the UUCP
# map available to the UUCP community (or some subset of).  The maps on
# these machines are the same as posted here, although they are updated
# more frequently than once per month.  If you missed a file or need
# an update in the middle of the month, please use the machine on this
# list which is closest to your area, and abide by the rules set up by
# the administrator of that machine.  Also, please keep in mind that
# the entire UUCP map is posted every month, so if you can wait
# for the next posting, we encourage you to do so.  This is a service provided
# on a volunteer basis by these machines, and if the privilege is abused,
# it will likely disappear.
#
# The map posted monthly has been checked as a unit for errors; the daily
# maps sometimes contain errors which are cleaned up in the monthly posting.

# 
# 
# To pick up the UUCP map from ihnp4, use the command:
# 
# 	uucp -m ihnp4!~/uumap/.info !~/uumap/
# 
# 		After you receive notification:
# 
# 	cat /usr/spool/uucppublic/uumap/.info
# 
# 		and follow the instructions.
# 
# If ihnp4 has a direct connection to your system, an alternative is:
# 
# 	uux ihnp4!uupub uumap
# 
# 		ihnp4 will send the uucpmap database to your
# 		system!~/uumap/ and will mail you notification.

# Rutgers has automated its map updating procedures.  As map updates reach

# receive them via uucp.  Under normal circumstances we can handle
# traffic only within the state of New Jersey.  However, if you have a
# special need, contact us.  We may be able to help.  We do not maintain
# a public uucp login.  To receive map updates, you'll need to contact
# us and establish a uucp login.  Once established, any part of the maps
# may be retrieved.

# 
# On seismo, the uucp map will be available in the directory ~uucp/uumap.
# Each state,etc. will have a file containing the data for uucpsites
# in that state. The filename will be the same as that used for the Usenet
# map (e.g. usa.va, usa.oh, eur.nl, can.on, etc).
# 
# A listing of the files in the directory can be obtained by running
# 	uux seismo!listmap user@site.UUCP
# where user@site.UUCP is a return address for mail.
# 
# Sites already having uucp connections with seismo may uucp the map at
# any time, but should initiate the call if it is long distance.
# 
# ARPAnet sites will find the data in the same format in ~ftp/uumap on seismo.
# It may be ftped with the standard anonymous login.

# The uucpmap information is available to our uucp neighbors in
# the ~maps directory on sys1.  The file names follow the normal
# u.* and d.* standards. A current index of the maps is in the
# file ~maps/current-index. The only restriction will be, if you
# queue up any of the maps and your site is long distance from sys1
# they will not be sent to you until you initiate the call.
# 
# A program is available for you to have the maps sent to your
# site in compressed (16 bits) form. The program works as follows
# 	uux sys1!mapsend {filename} {system name} {where you want it}
# 
# where 
# 	uux sys1!mapsend u.usa.tx.1 foovax ~uucp/maps/compressed
# 
# will send the map u.usa.tx.1 into your ~uucp/maps/compressed
# 
# or
# 	uux sys1!mapsend u.usa.tx.1 barvax stdin
# 
# will compress the requested map and send it via uux to the standard
# input of a program called 'maprcv' which needs should be a program
# that can read and uncompress the incomeing data.  argv[1] will
# equal the requested map without the .Z extention..
# 
# Please note: we will only send maps to our uucp neighbors.
