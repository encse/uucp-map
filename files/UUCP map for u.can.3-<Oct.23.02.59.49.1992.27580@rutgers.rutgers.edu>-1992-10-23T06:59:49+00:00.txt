#	a 14-member Board of Directors that includes four
#	international members, ICOD initiates and supports programs
#	to develop indigenous expertise and institutions in
#	developing countries for the improved management and
#	utilization of ocean resources, particularly as a source of

#	initiatives that will help developing countries to improve
#	their own management and use of ocean resources in a
#	rational and sustainable manner.  Programs are supported at
#	the global level where warranted and on behalf of coastal
#	and island countries in four regions: the Caribbean Basin,
#	South Pacific, South and West Indian Ocean, and West
#	Africa.  ICOD's program scope embraces all scientific,
#	social, and economic aspects of ocean resource development.
#	Particular emphasis is placed on human resource development
#	and institutional strengthening in developing countries.
