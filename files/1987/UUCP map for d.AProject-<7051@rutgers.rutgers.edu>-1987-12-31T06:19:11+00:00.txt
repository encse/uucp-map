#  This is the UUCP Mapping Project's miscellaneous data file.  Here you'll
#  find temporary patches which, because of this file's name, will become part
#  of the input to pathalias.  In general, we will use this file to keep
#  pathalias from generating known bad or unreliable paths.

#  As far as can be determined, most of the links to osu-eddie were links to
#  the old system.  A new system is now in place and we're given to believe
#  that not all of the old links still exist.  To keep mail from being routed
#  through these old links accidentally, this site and the real site name that
#  osu-eddie is now an alias for are being declared dead.  As soon as this
#  situation is cleared up, this declaration will be removed.
